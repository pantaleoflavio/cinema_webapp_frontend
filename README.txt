# Cinema Showcase

A Frontend Project that simulate a Cinema Webapp. The project has a main page, where is possible to watch 
a Pic gallery, the available Movies, the Halls and choose an action, like to watch the specific movie page,
with the whole infos and the trailer of the movie (now it s implemented just one movie page).
It is possible to check the Hall page, where it is possible to book a place and to watch a gallery of the Hall,
there is a section for tosearch the desired movie, with desired date etc.
The Webapp has also two modals (not jet implemented) one for a customer login, the other for the movie search
section.
The header has a list (not jet implemented) and the footer the logo and social links.
The image gallery is dynamic, it can be possible to scroll through the images, with arrows and dots.

The pages are all responsive, for to improve the user experience.

The whole project will be implemented, in both sides, Front- and Backend, now I think it is enough to show my
frontend skills: the project was written by using the follow techs:
- HTML
- CSS
- fundaments of SASS
- Bootstrap 4
- Javascript
- Libraries like Owl Carousel
- JQuery also for the built of the APIs

The project need obviously an implementation, like the pages of the navbar, the modals, a dynamically creation of
the Movie pages (with PHP), a Database.
