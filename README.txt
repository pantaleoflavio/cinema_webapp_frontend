# Future Development #
While the current version of the project focuses on showcasing frontend skills, the intention is to implement both frontend and backend components in the future. This will further enhance the functionality and capabilities of the web application.

# How to Run #
Since this project is currently focused on the frontend, there are no specific steps required for setup. Simply open the HTML files in a web browser to view and interact with the web application.
Be sure to include the Owl Carousel Dependencies.

For future backend implementation, detailed setup instructions will be provided (Already started here: https://github.com/pantaleoflavio/cinemaAppFS . It been rebuilt from scratch the whole Frontend Structure).

The project need obviously an implementation, like the pages of the navbar, the modals, a dynamically creation of
the Movie pages (with PHP), a Database.
